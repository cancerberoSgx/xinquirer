# Motivation: 

 
This project is a joke, i'm loading electron jast for this. The reality is that I don't like developing UIs, don't want to waste time on it, and I need to interact with users in a UI application and text / command line in that environment is not good: I need to render dialogs on top of the other app!

I'm starting developing typescript plugins (not for the public just for me - to play!) and I don't want to learn any editor oro IDE API - just with typescript compiler API i have enough. so I need a cheap way of putting inquierer-like dialogs on top of the user's IDE / editors asking him for files, confirmation, etc.
